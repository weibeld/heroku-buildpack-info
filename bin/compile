# Display contents of various directories of the build dyno during the build.
# This buildpack just delivers information, it doesn't do any transformations
# on the application slug.
#
# ---
#
# The 'compile' script is executed by the slug compiler with three arguments:
#   1. build_dir: location of your app directory on the build dyno
#   2. cache_dir: directory on the build dyno that persists between builds
#   3. env_dir:   directory holding all the app's config vars as files

The 'compile' script is supposed to make transformations here
(e.g. installing binaries). After that, this dir is called
slug and loaded as /app onto the dynos running for the app.
